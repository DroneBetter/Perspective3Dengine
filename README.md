# Perspective 3D engine
A 3D engine with quaternion rotation, for simulating gravity and classical billiards physics, with collisions between discrete frame intervals.

## Controls
You can play with WASD motion and mouse panning like Minecraft, but the keys affect velocity (which doesn't decay in space mode) and if you look around in a clockwise circle you will end up rotated anticlockwise in the roll axis. You can also use R and F to move up and down, Q and E for roll and the arrow keys for yaw and pitch.

## Play in browser
The most recent version (where you control a ball in space with n-body gravity) is [here](https://turbowarp.org/574159176/fullscreen), the first version (with only the rendering, no physics) is [here](https://turbowarp.org/575040192/fullscreen).
